# Alamo Advise Model Analysis
## About the Project
### Background
You have been asked to give an update on the percentage of students with formal academic plan status. The institution is required to maintain 95% threshold that affects student persistence, engagement and completion. In particular, senior leadership would like to know the following:

### Goals
>1. Has the advising team as a unit met the 95% goal? 
>2. In instances where goal attainment is below expected target, what are the reasons?
>3. College Leadership has a hypothesis that hours earned is impacting the 95% goal. Identify any possible patterns that may support hypothesis.
